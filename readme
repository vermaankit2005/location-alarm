## Features
- Create location-based alarms (geofences) with configurable radius.
- Trigger audible/visual notifications when entering or exiting a geofence.
- Persist saved locations and alarm settings.
- Runs in background (service/foreground-notification) to monitor location.
- Simple UI to add, edit and remove location alarms.

(Adjust or expand features based on actual implementation in app/ if needed.)

## Screenshots
Add screenshots to the `docs/` or `assets/` folder and reference them here:

## Requirements
- Android Studio (recommended)
- Android SDK (compile & target according to project Gradle configuration)
- Java (project is written in Java)
- Gradle wrapper is included (use ./gradlew)

Check `app/build.gradle` for exact compileSdkVersion / targetSdkVersion and update your SDK accordingly.

## Build & install

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/vermaankit2005/location-alarm.git
   cd location-alarm

2. Open the project in Android Studio
   - File → Open... → select the project folder
   - Allow Android Studio to sync Gradle and download dependencies

   OR build from command line:
   ./gradlew assembleDebug

3. Install to a connected device or emulator:
   adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

Notes:
- Use a real device for reliable location/geofence testing (emulators can simulate location but behavior varies).
- Ensure Google Play services (if used) are available on the device/emulator.

## Permissions
Location-based apps typically require runtime and manifest permissions. Verify and grant the required permissions at runtime on Android 6.0+:

- ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (high accuracy location)
- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION (optional)
- ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION (Android 10+ if monitoring while app is backgrounded)
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE (if using a foreground service to monitor location)
- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED (if alarms/geofences should persist after reboot)
- WAKE_LOCK (if keeping the CPU awake for critical work)

Check `AndroidManifest.xml` and the runtime permission requests in the code; update them to match current platform requirements.

---

## Usage
1. Launch the app on your device.
2. Tap "Add location" (or equivalent UI) and select a location on the map or enter coordinates.
3. Choose radius and whether to trigger on enter, exit, or both.
4. Select alarm sound or notification settings if available.
5. Save the geofence/alarm.
6. Ensure location services (GPS) are enabled and grant requested permissions.
7. Move into or out of the configured area to trigger the alarm.

## Notes & troubleshooting
- Android OS aggressively optimizes battery and may restrict background location updates; test on a device with battery optimizations disabled for the app.
- On Android 10+ you must request background location permission separately; on Android 11+ follow new permission flows.
- If geofences are not triggering:
  - Verify location is enabled and the device can obtain GPS fix.
  - Check app permissions.
  - Check device manufacturer-specific battery optimizations (Huawei, Xiaomi, OnePlus, etc.) and whitelist the app.
  - Look at logcat for exceptions or error messages.
